I am a tenure-track assistant professor in Statistics and Data Analysis at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science ([Compute](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/)), Technical University of Denmark ([DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/)). I received my PhD from [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland in 2021 within [Speech and Language Technology](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/items/1abb540f-0c97-4d7f-98b3-e88b15f08539) under the guidance of [Tom Bäckström](https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/tom-backstrom). Prior to this, I did my MSc in Communication and Multimedia Engineering from [FAU](https://www.fau.eu/) (Friedrich-Alexander-Universität) Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany in 2016 and my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2013 (BMS Institute of Technology, India). I was born in [Kolkata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata) (Eastern [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)), and lived most of my life in [Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore) (Southern India).

My research is on the following broad themes:
* **AI-safety**: How to ensure the robustness and reliability (among other safety metrics) of models in high-stakes applications? How can we formalize participatory frameworks for HITL systems? How can we integrate non-zero-sum representation for conflicting values in AI systems.
* **Low-resource ML**: In my ideal world, a system that works for one should work for all. How to ensure that models work with high-fidelity under resource (data, compute) constraints?

I work with multi-sensory data, that includes speech and audio, biosignals and visual data modalities, with applications in (mental) healthcare. That said, after years of working with speech signals, it is still one of my favorite signal modalities :-) My research incorporates shared perspective from signal processing, statistics, machine-learning. Equity, accessibility are inclusivity are (usually) the undertones in my research.

I am also interested in questions on ‘AI-alignment’ at the intersection of technical and non-technical perspectives., alongside AI-safety and reliability, providing the foundational grounding and direction to my research.

Given the ubiquity and the influence of technology in our lives, I strongly believe in the need for interdisciplinary teams for development and advancement of technologies - and I strive to put this in my research practice.

NOTE: If you are interested in these research areas, would like to know more or would like to point me towards your cool research in the domain, feel free to drop a message. I am constantly on a lookout for motivated students and fellow researchers working on similar and complimentary areas.

NOTE for potential students: I constantly mentor students on [research and development projects](https://snehadas.github.io/supervision/). Feel free to reach out if you are interested in any of the above research topics.
